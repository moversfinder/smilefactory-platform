# 11. Comprehensive Code Review Process

## üéØ **Code Review Philosophy**

Our code review process is designed to ensure **modular architecture**, **scalability**, and **clear separation of concerns**. Every code change must demonstrate adherence to our architectural principles before being merged.

## üìã **Architectural Review Priorities**

### **1. Modularity Assessment**
- **Component Independence**: Each component/service can be modified without affecting others
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear, stable interfaces between modules
- **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies flow in one direction (no circular dependencies)
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between modules

### **2. Scalability Review**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Code supports adding more instances/servers
- **Database Scalability**: Queries and schema support large datasets
- **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching for performance
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal use of memory and CPU

### **3. Separation of Concerns**
- **Frontend**: Presentation logic separated from business logic
- **Backend**: Clear boundaries between services and layers
- **Database**: Proper normalization and relationship design
- **Cross-Cutting**: Logging, security, and monitoring properly abstracted

## üîç **Review Checklist by Layer**

### **Frontend Architecture Review**

#### **Component Design**
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- [ ] **Props Interface**: Well-defined, typed props with clear contracts
- [ ] **State Management**: Local state vs global state appropriately used
- [ ] **Side Effects**: Properly managed with hooks (useEffect, custom hooks)
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and user feedback
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained

#### **Service Layer**
- [ ] **Interface Abstraction**: Services use interfaces for backend communication
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all API calls
- [ ] **Caching**: Appropriate use of React Query/RTK Query for caching
- [ ] **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with no `any` types
- [ ] **Testing**: Unit tests for all business logic

#### **Performance**
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: No unnecessary dependencies or large imports
- [ ] **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes loaded on demand
- [ ] **Memoization**: Appropriate use of React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- [ ] **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists and data sets

### **Backend Architecture Review**

#### **Microservice Design**
- [ ] **Domain Boundaries**: Clear domain boundaries with no overlap
- [ ] **API Design**: RESTful principles with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication between services
- [ ] **Database Per Service**: Each service owns its data
- [ ] **Stateless**: Services are stateless and horizontally scalable

#### **Code Quality**
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI for testability and flexibility
- [ ] **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper logging
- [ ] **Transaction Management**: Appropriate transaction boundaries
- [ ] **Security**: Input validation, authentication, authorization

#### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **Database Queries**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- [ ] **Caching**: Redis/in-memory caching where appropriate
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- [ ] **Async Processing**: Long-running tasks handled asynchronously
- [ ] **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance patterns implemented

### **Database Review**

#### **Schema Design**
- [ ] **Normalization**: Appropriate level of normalization
- [ ] **Indexing**: Proper indexes for query performance
- [ ] **Constraints**: Foreign keys, check constraints for data integrity
- [ ] **Partitioning**: Large tables partitioned for performance
- [ ] **Future Expansion**: Schema supports adding new features

#### **Scalability**
- [ ] **Horizontal Scaling**: Schema supports sharding if needed
- [ ] **Read Replicas**: Queries can use read replicas
- [ ] **Data Archiving**: Strategy for old data management
- [ ] **Migration Strategy**: Safe, reversible database migrations

## üöÄ **Review Process Workflow**

### **1. Pre-Review (Author)**
- **Linting**: Run code formatting and style checks
- **Testing**: Execute all unit and integration tests
- **Type Checking**: Verify TypeScript type safety
- **Build**: Ensure successful compilation

### **2. Automated Checks**
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Unit Tests**: >85% code coverage required
- **Integration Tests**: Critical paths tested
