# 18. Process Flow JIRA Workflow Integration

## üéØ **Overview**

This document outlines the specific JIRA workflow configurations and automation rules needed to support the Authentication and Profile Creation Process Flows. It extends the existing JIRA-GitHub integration to include process flow-specific tracking and automation.

## üìã **Process Flow Epic Structure**

### **Authentication Process Flow Epic**
**Epic Key**: `SMILE-AUTH-FLOW`
**Epic Name**: `Authentication Process Implementation`
**Epic Description**: 
```
Implement the complete authentication process flow enabling users to create accounts through multiple methods (email/password, social authentication, phone/SMS) with the shortest possible user journey.

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can authenticate via email/password, social providers, or phone/SMS
- Authentication creates personal_details record with UUID
- Users are redirected to dashboard with profile creation prompt
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss
- All authentication methods integrate seamlessly

**Architecture Requirements**:
- personal_details table serves as authentication foundation
- Support for multiple profile types per user via UUID foreign keys
- Proper indexing and performance optimization
- Security compliance with JWT tokens and encryption
```

### **Profile Creation Process Flow Epic**
**Epic Key**: `SMILE-PROFILE-FLOW`
**Epic Name**: `Profile Creation Process Implementation`
**Epic Description**:
```
Implement the 3-step profile creation process allowing users to select profile type, enter personal information, and complete profile-specific details with stage-by-stage completion support.

**Success Criteria**:
- 3-step profile creation process (type selection, personal info, profile details)
- Auto-save functionality at each step
- Support for all 8 profile types with dynamic forms
- Profile completion tracking and progress indicators
- Multiple profiles per user architecture support

**Architecture Requirements**:
- Separate database calls for each completed step
- Profile-specific tables linked via personal_details UUID
- Draft state management and recovery mechanisms
- Performance optimization for form interactions
```

## üîÑ **JIRA Automation Rules for Process Flows**

### **Automated Story Creation**
```yaml
# Rule: Auto-create related stories when epic is created
Trigger: Epic Created
Condition: Epic key contains "AUTH-FLOW" OR "PROFILE-FLOW"
Action: Create linked stories based on epic type

# Authentication Flow Epic ‚Üí Auto-create 8 stories
# Profile Creation Flow Epic ‚Üí Auto-create 8 stories
```

### **Progress Tracking Automation**
```yaml
# Rule: Update epic progress when stories complete
Trigger: Story transitioned to "Done"
Condition: Story is linked to AUTH-FLOW or PROFILE-FLOW epic
Action: 
  - Update epic progress percentage
  - Add comment with completion status
  - Notify epic assignee if epic is complete
```

### **Cross-Team Coordination**
